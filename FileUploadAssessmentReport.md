# E-Commerce Web application Assessment

## Objective
I have been contracted to perform a penetration test for a company's e-commerce web application. The web application is in its early stages, so I'll be testing testing any file upload forms that i can find.

### Description

Once i logged in with the credentials that was provided I notice a contact form in the menu section. I proceed to the page where it display four different user input fields (Name, Email, Message and file upload field). I proceed to the image upload field since the client wanted me to test for file upload vulnerabillities. 

I see that the field only accepted image files so I upload an image to see how the application will respond, nothing out of the oridinary. I then upload a file with a different extention (.txt) and a error pop up informing me to "Please select a file". So that tells me that this application has client side validation and possibly back-end validation. SO i proceed to try to bypass the client side validation by right-clicking to inspect the application front-end code. I notice an onchange() and a accept attribute, so i deleted the values tied to those then proceed to uploading the same file and got a different error of "Extention not allowed".

So now the next goal here was to create a JPEG like image by using magic bytes. Here are the step i completed to do that:

1. I downloaded a jpeg file.
2. I used a command called `xxd` to get the beginning bytes of this file by using the command </br> `xxd image_name.jpeg | head `
3. This command showed me the first line of those bytes </br>
4. Once i had the bytes i started constucting my jpeg like image with the following commands
    *   `echo -n -e \xFF\xD8\xFF\xE0\x00\x10\4A\x46\x49\x46\x00\01\x01\x00\x00\x01 > exploit.txt`
    * Then to confirm that the file reads as a JPEG file i ran the command </br>`file exploit.txt`
    * Output confirm: `exploit.txt: JPEG image data

Once I created my jpeg like image I went back to the user upload field to upload my file i just created and once i export it and hit upload it sent a request to my burp letting me know i successful bypassed the client side validation.
